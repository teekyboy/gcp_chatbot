This code enables the creation of a database on Firbase and facilitates answering queries utilizing the said database. The vectors are preserved within Pinecone.

Queries and responses are recorded in a csv on Firebase. It is no longer necessary for the uploaded files to originate from local uploads.

Used Google Secret Manager to store all keys.
